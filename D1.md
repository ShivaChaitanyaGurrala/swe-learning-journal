## 🚧 Issues Encountered & Solutions

### 🔧 Issue 1: Poetry Command Not Recognized
**Problem:** After installing Poetry via pip, `poetry --version` returned "command not recognized"  
**Root Cause:** Windows PATH not updated with Poetry's installation directory  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Added Poetry Scripts directory to PATH
$poetryScriptsPath = "C:\Users\shiva\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python313\Scripts"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $currentPath + ";" + $poetryScriptsPath, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```
**Lesson Learned:** Windows PATH updates require session refresh or manual PATH modification

### 🔧 Issue 2: GitHub CLI Not Found
**Problem:** `gh auth login` command not recognized after installation  
**Root Cause:** Similar PATH issue - GitHub CLI not added to system PATH  
**Solution:** Restart terminal and verify installation path, add to PATH if needed  
**Alternative:** Use GitHub Desktop for GUI-based Git operations

### 🔧 Issue 3: Hyper-V Not Available
**Problem:** Windows 10 Home doesn't support Hyper-V containers feature  
**Root Cause:** Hyper-V is only available on Windows Pro/Enterprise editions  
**Solution:** Used WSL 2 backend for Docker Desktop  
**Outcome:** WSL 2 actually provides better performance for development

### 🔧 Issue 4: PostgreSQL Container Startup Failure
**Problem:** PostgreSQL container failed to start, only Redis and MongoDB running  
**Root Cause:** Multi-line PowerShell commands didn't pass environment variables correctly  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Used single-line command instead of multi-line with backslashes
docker run --name postgres-dev -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=devdb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:15
```
**Lesson Learned:** PowerShell uses backticks (`) for line continuation, not backslashes (\)

### 🔧 Issue 5: Poetry Shell Command Deprecated
**Problem:** `poetry shell` command not available in Poetry 2.0+  
**Root Cause:** Poetry 2.0+ removed shell command by default  
**Solution:** Use `poetry run` for executing commands in virtual environment  
**Best Practice:** `poetry run python main.py` instead of activating shell

### 🔧 Issue 6: Invalid TOML File from PowerShell
**Problem:** Poetry couldn't parse manually created pyproject.toml  
**Root Cause:** PowerShell's `Out-File` added BOM (Byte Order Mark) to file  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Used UTF8NoBOM encoding
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("pyproject.toml", $content, [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))
```
**Alternative:** Create files in VS Code to avoid encoding issues
